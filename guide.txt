Complete Installation Guide
Step 1: Install Node.js
    Option 1: Download from Official Website

    Go to Node.js official website

    Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version for your operating system

    Run the installer and follow the setup wizard

    Option 2: Using Node Version Manager (Recommended for advanced users)

    Windows: nvm-windows

    macOS/Linux: nvm

    Verify Installation:

    Open Gitbash or Terminal
    node --version
    npm --version

    Step 2: Project Setup
    1. Open terminal/command prompt in your project root directory
    2. Install root dependencies:
        npm install
    3. Navigate to server directory and install server dependencies:
        cd server
        npm install
        cd ..

    Step 3: Environment Configuration
    1. Create .env file in the root directory:
        # On Linux/macOS
        touch .env

        # On Windows (Command Prompt)
        type nul > .env

        # On Windows (PowerShell)
        New-Item .env -ItemType File

    2. Copy contents from environmental.txt to .env
        Open environmental.txt
        Copy all content
        Paste into the newly created .env file

    4. Import mysql database from the supabase
        student_Voting_system.sql
    
    5.Start the Application
        Terminal 1 - Start Nodes:
                                    npm run start-nodes
        Terminal 2 - Start Main Application:
                                    npm run dev
        Terminal 3 - Start Server:
                                    cd server
                                    npm run dev
    
    Troubleshooting Tips:
                If Node.js commands aren't recognized: Restart your terminal after Node.js installation

                If ports are busy: Check that ports 3000, 3001, 3002 (or whatever your app uses) are available

                If dependencies fail: Try deleting node_modules and package-lock.json, then run npm install again

                Permission issues (Linux/macOS): Sometimes you may need to use sudo for global installations, but avoid it for project dependencies

                Required Ports
                Make sure these ports are available (typical defaults):

                Main app: 3000

                Server: 3001

                Nodes: 3002, 3003 (or as configured in your environment)
